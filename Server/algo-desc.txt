How the algorithm will work to give a risk score (0-1) for a person:

Will be calculated at every stop

Input (currently):
 - # w/ mask and # w/o mask
 - Number of people on bus
 - Risk scores of every other person
 - Duration of the bus ride
 - Percent currently infected
 - Historic risk data (ie risk from each ride for past 14 days)

Process:
 - Count number of people and get their risk score
 - Risk score represents probability that they have it
 - So do 1-risk for each and multiply together
 - That gives you probability no one has it
 - So do 1-total_prob to get total_risk (ie risk of the entire bus just based on previous risk)

 - Next, we modify that total risk with global bus data
 - Get the number of mask wearers / total
 - Multiply that by (17.4/3.1). If below 1, make it 1 (cause we don't want to increase risk, we only decrease)
 - Divide total risk by that number, so that's corrected by mask wearing

 - Next we use distance of everyone else ie proximity
 - Get proportion of people sitting that are > 1m apart divided by total
 - Mult that by (12.8/2.6). If below 1, make it 1 (cause we don't want to increase risk, we only decrease)
 - Divide total risk by that number, so that's corrected by distance

 - Finally we correct using the duration of the bus ride
 - Based on rough estimates, need around 1000 virus particles to be infected
 - So say very little talking, thats 20 virus particals per minute, so 50 minutes for 1000
 - Use some sort of constant, divide time by 50 (max it out at 1) and that's how much your risk increases

 - OPTIONAL: Adding coughs
 - Say max 5 coughs, mult by some constant and mult that into the bus risk

After ride evaluation:
 - You get saved that risk score from the bus
 - Then to get your risk score, mult all (1-bus_score) together and do 1 minus that
